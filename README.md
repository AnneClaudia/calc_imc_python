# BMI Calculator

The BMI Calculator is a beginner-level project developed in Python. It is designed to help users calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI), a widely used metric that indicates whether an individual has a healthy body weight for a given height.

Key Features:
User-Friendly Interface: The application uses the Tkinter library to create a simple graphical user interface (GUI). Users can input their weight and height into designated fields and receive instant feedback on their BMI.
Real-Time Calculations: Once the user inputs their weight and height, the application immediately calculates their BMI using the standard formula: 
𝐵𝑀𝐼 = 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡ℎ / 𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡²

Categorization: The program categorizes the BMI result into various health ranges, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obesity, providing users with an easy-to-understand interpretation of their BMI score.
Responsive Design: The application adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring it remains usable across various devices and resolutions.
Reset Functionality: Users can easily clear their inputs and start over with the reset button, making the application more interactive and user-friendly.
Educational Value:
This project is an excellent starting point for beginners learning Python and GUI development. It covers basic programming concepts, including conditionals, functions, and user input handling, as well as an introduction to creating GUIs with Tkinter. Additionally, the BMI Calculator project provides a practical way to apply Python skills to solve real-world problems, reinforcing learning and making coding more engaging.
